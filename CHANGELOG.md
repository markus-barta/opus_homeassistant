# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.6] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed
- **Commands now use correct JSON format**: Fixed command payload to use `{"state": {"functions": [...]}}` format instead of `{"telegram": {...}}`. The bridge's `put` endpoint expects a `state` object, not a `telegram` wrapper.

## [0.0.5] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed
- **State updates now work with flattened MQTT structure**: Rewrote telegram handler to parse flattened MQTT topics (like device discovery) instead of expecting JSON payloads. State changes from physical switches now properly update entity states in Home Assistant.

## [0.0.4] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed
- **Commands now use correct device ID**: Fixed critical bug where commands were sent using the friendly name (e.g., `KG_Vorrat-1K-1`) instead of the actual EnOcean device ID (e.g., `01A02F6C`). This prevented lights, switches, and covers from responding to commands.
- **Updated repository URLs**: Fixed documentation and issue tracker URLs in manifest to point to the correct repository (`opus_homeassistant`).

## [0.0.3] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed
- **Icon display in Home Assistant**: Moved `icon.png` and `logo.png` to integration root folder for proper display in the UI.

## [0.0.2] - 2024-11-24

### Fixed
- **Device discovery with flattened MQTT structure**: Rewrote coordinator to handle Opus GreenNet's flattened MQTT topic structure (one topic per property) instead of JSON payloads.

### Changed
- Subscribe to `EnOcean/{EAG}/stream/devices/#` wildcard topic
- Aggregate device properties from individual MQTT messages
- Discovery timer waits for all properties before creating entities
